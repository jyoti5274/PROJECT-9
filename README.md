Short Description: FaultFindy leverages Deep Learning to predict faulty tyres during the manufacturing process, enabling proactive optimization and reduced waste.

Problem Addressed: Traditional quality control methods often identify faulty tyres only after production, leading to waste and inefficiency. FaultFindy addresses this by predicting faults early in the process, allowing for corrective actions and improved production quality.

Key Features:

Deep Learning Model: Analyzes various manufacturing parameters and process data to predict faulty tyres with high accuracy.
Proactive Quality Control: Enables manufacturers to identify and address potential issues before they become actual defects, reducing waste and rework.
Improved Production Efficiency: By optimizing processes based on predictions, manufacturers can achieve higher production efficiency and throughput.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and integrate seamlessly into existing manufacturing lines.
Target Audience:

Manufacturing engineers and data scientists working in the tyre industry.
Companies seeking to improve production efficiency and quality control in tyre manufacturing.
Usage:

Data Collection: Integrate FaultFindy with sensors and systems that capture manufacturing parameters and process data.
Model Training: Train the Deep Learning model on labelled historical data of faulty and non-faulty tyres.
Prediction: During production, the model analyzes real-time data and predicts the probability of a tyre being faulty.
Proactive Actions: Based on predictions, manufacturers can take corrective actions such as adjusting process parameters or flagging tyres for further inspection.
